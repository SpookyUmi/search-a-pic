# Search a pic 

I'm using Pixabay API for this project.

## Stack

- React & React Hooks
- Sass
- Axios

Packages : 
- Lodash
- React Image Lightbox

## Organization

After reading [Pixabay's API documentation](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/), I prepared my environment : 
- Create React App, 
- GitHub Repository, 
- deploy on Netlify.


Then, using a simple **input** on my App component, **I connected my application to Pixabay's API** and performed the first calls. The idea was to set up the **useEffect** and **async/await** function to fetch the datas we want, and verify if we're successfully connected to the API. I also began to build my **local state using useState**.


Then I **structured** my application by building all the **components** I estimated necessary. As the call to the API was implemented and functional, I didn't need to **mock** with fake data and I directly passed my **props** to the components, especially my Results component where I needed all the images received from the API. 


I **styled** my app using **Sass** variables and nesting, and using **BEM** methodology for my CSS selectors class names. I also added the **React Image Lightbox** package to make the app a little more **interactive** : you can click on a photo and it will appear bigger over the app's content. You can also pass the photos thanks to the lateral arrows. 

## Application operation

I chose **two different ways to search photos** and by extension to perform a call to the API : 
- The classic way with an **onSubmit** event plugged on my search Form : the form catches the input's value thanks to useRef and send it to our local state which triggers a re-render. 
- You can also write in the input and wait for 1sec without submitting the form. Using **debounce** and **onChange**, the app will memorize your last move and send the input's value to the local state after 1 second (that's comfortable especially when you're using the app on a mobile phone).

I also chose to pass a **default value** to the search state, that way a call to the API is performed right after the render and the page isn't empty. I found it more interesting that way.

## Experience feedback

When you reach the app page, you load 200 images in their largest version. The API's payload my app receives contains 3 different versions of the image I want to display. I choose directly the largest version, `largeImageURL` but it's not the best at all if I want to improve perf. I then decided to change it for a smaller version of the image (`previewURL` or `webFormatURL`) as the interface doesn't display the images in full size. Nevertheless, when you click on the image, the app load the largest version for you to appreciate the image's quality at its best.
